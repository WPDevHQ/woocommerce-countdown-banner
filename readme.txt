== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens after the countdown has expired? =

When the counter reaches zero the promotional banner will disappear automatically.

No need for you to remember to login and turn it off.

= Will the countdown also be visible on mobile devices? =

Yes, the countdown banner is responsive for all devices.

= Can I customize the countdown banner? =

Yes, you can customize the Display Text as well as the Background and Text colors from the WooCommerce General settings tab.

Developers can also target the `.wc-store-countdown-notice` element with their own custom CSS styles, if desired.

= What exactly does the Relative Time setting do? =

I'm glad you asked! This setting can be a little confusing to understand at first, but it's actually very handy for stores that ship internationally.

If relative time is enabled, the banner will try to detect customer's timezone so that the same countdown end time will apply for all customers, no matter their location.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York** and also at **3:00pm in Paris**. No matter where your customer is, the banner will disappear at 3:00pm.

In contrast, if relative time is disabled, the countdown will end at the _same moment in time_ no matter where your customers are.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York**, but at **9:00pm in Paris**.
