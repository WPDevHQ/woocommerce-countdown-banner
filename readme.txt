Display an animated store-wide countdown banner for special promotions or launches.

== Description ==

This plugin tells your customers that they need to act fast by featuring a countdown banner above the header of your WooCommerce store.

 * Perfect for limited time store-wide sales or promotions
 * Create excitement and buzz for new product launches or arrivals
 * Display before your store officially opens to build anticipation for launch
 * Customize the look and feel of your banner with just a few clicks
 * Advanced controls for promoting to all your customers in multiple timezones

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens after the countdown has expired? =

When the counter reaches zero the promotional banner will disappear automatically.

No need for you to remember to login and turn it off.

= Will the countdown also be visible on mobile devices? =

Yes, the countdown banner is responsive for all devices.

= Can I customize the countdown banner? =

Yes, you can customize the Display Text as well as the Background and Text colors from the WooCommerce General settings tab.

Developers can also target the `.wc-store-countdown-banner` element with their own custom CSS styles, if desired.

= What exactly does the Relative Time setting do? =

I'm glad you asked! This setting can be a little confusing to understand at first, but it's actually very handy for stores that ship internationally.

If relative time is enabled, the countdown banner will try to detect your customers' timezones so that the same end time will apply for all customers, no matter their location.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York** and also at **3:00pm in Paris**. No matter where your customers are in the world, the countdown will end _at 3:00pm their time_.

In contrast, if relative time is disabled, the countdown will end at the _same moment in time_ for everyone.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York**, but at **9:00pm in Paris**. Because of the timezone difference between New York and Paris, this is actually the same moment in time.
