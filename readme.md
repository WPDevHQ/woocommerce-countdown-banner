## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What happens after the countdown has expired? ###
When the counter reaches zero the promotional banner will disappear automatically.

There's no need for you to remember to login and turn it off.

### How can I customize the banner more than the options allow? ###
Advanced users can target the `.wc-countdown-banner` element, and its child elements, with their own custom CSS. Feel free to reposition and style the banner however you like!

There are also two hooks available for developers to add their own markup to banners: `woocommerce_before_countdown_banner` and `woocommerce_after_countdown_banner`

### What exactly does the Relative Time setting do? ###
We're glad you asked! This setting can be a little confusing to understand at first, but it's actually very handy for stores that ship internationally.

If relative time is enabled, the countdown banner will try to detect your customers' timezones so that the same end time will apply for all customers, no matter their location.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York** and also at **3:00pm in Paris**. No matter where your customers are in the world, the countdown will end _at 3:00pm their time_.

In contrast, if relative time is disabled, the countdown will end at the _same moment in time_ for everyone.

For example, the countdown will end at **3:00pm in New York**, but at **9:00pm in Paris**. Because of the timezone difference between New York and Paris, this is actually the same moment in time.
